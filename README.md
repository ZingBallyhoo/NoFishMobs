# NoFishMobs
### Spigot plugin to disable spawning of fish mobs

Important info:
* 1.13.2 only (due to use of NMS)
* Removes **all** fish mobs (cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish) from biome mob spawn tables.
* Spigot
* I don't know java
* Server restart is probably required to load, biomes might already be loaded.
* Plugin disable does nothing, server restart is required to remove.
